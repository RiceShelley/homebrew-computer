CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/clk is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][0]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][10]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][11]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][12]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][13]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][14]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][15]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][1]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][2]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][3]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][4]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][5]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][6]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][7]/C, risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/mem_reg[0][8]/C (the first 15 of 4100 listed)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock risc16System_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT risc16System_i/risc16_0/inst/mem/pc[15]_i_3 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
